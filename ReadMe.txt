Install:
To install UO Architect. There are 3 main file groups:

 - UO Architect 2.6 Client (main application)
 - UO Architect Server 1.0, (Runuo 1.0)
 - UO Architect Server 2.0, (Runuo 2.0)
 
 UOAR SERVER INSTALL:
 Depending on the Server you use for RunUO, 1 or 2, you will need to drop the contents of the uoar server 1.0 or 2.0 files into your runuo server root directory.
  
 Then run your Server. It should say that the Uo Architect server has loaded on port 2594. If you see this you installed the uoar server file specific to the version of runuo your using correctly.
 
 The UO Architect Client 2.6 is the main application for UO Architect, this DOES NOT GO IN YOUR RUNUO DIRECTORY. And is the main application for storing and editing your buildings.
 
 UOAR CLIENT SETUP:
 Once you have your runuo 1.0 / 2.0 Server running with the currect version of the uoar server 1.0 or 2.0 running on your server. 
 
 you need to goto the uoar connection wizard and setup your servers ip, if you are running the runuo server, uoar client, on the same computer your ip in the connection wizard in the uoar client is 127.0.0.1, port 2594, your admin username, and password. Then save the info, and click ok.
 
 From here you can then click the name of your server, then add your admin info and password, and opt to save your password or not. Then connect to your server. 
 
 Once you are connected to the runuo server, you need to load up your UO Client. From here you will be able to build buildings from the uoar database and placement in game using the build dialog box or you can extra static items from the uo map into the uoar database. When the new orbsyida devnet site is back online I"ll have more detailed videos and information on how to use uoar 2.6.
